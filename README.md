## Overview

This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website, nick-t.net.

The site serves as an interactive resume and technical case study showcase, designed to be fast, responsive, and aesthetically aligned with Systems and DevOps engineering principles.

# ‚ú® Key Technical Highlights

Absolutely! Adding a README.md for the portfolio itself‚Äîespecially one that frames it as a project‚Äîis crucial for a Systems/DevOps Engineer. It demonstrates proficiency in documentation and architectural communication.

Here is a comprehensive README.md template for your portfolio website, highlighting the technical implementation details we worked on.

Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website, nick-t.net.

The site serves as an interactive resume and technical case study showcase, designed to be fast, responsive, and aesthetically aligned with Systems and DevOps engineering principles.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Highlights
This portfolio is not just a collection of links; it is a technical demonstration of core skills, including modern design patterns, client-side scripting, security, and performance optimization.

### Frontend Architecture & Interactivity

* **Synchronized Typing Effect (Vanilla JS):** Engineered a complex, sequential typing animation using vanilla JavaScript to create a theatrical, on-brand introduction:
    * **Header:** Types a CLI command and response (e.g., `>>> whoami`).
    * **About Section:** Types the full professional summary within a stylized terminal window.
* **Custom Dark Theme & Layering:** Implemented a unified, high-contrast dark theme using **CSS Variables** and custom class layering (e.g., `#111111` section blend vs. `#212529` card color) for visual cohesion across all components.
* **Responsive Grid:** Utilizes the Bootstrap 5 grid system for a clean, professional, card-based layout that is fully responsive on mobile devices.

### Security & DevOps Principles

* **Contact Form Security:** Architected a secure contact mechanism using an external service endpoint (Formspree) to eliminate spam and ensure zero email exposure in the client-side code.
* **Performance Focus:** All styling and logic is handled by consolidated CSS and simple JavaScript, ensuring fast initial page load time and performance consistency across all sections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Development

This project is built using standard web technologies and requires no complex runtime dependencies, making it highly portable.

| Component | Technology/Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Markup** | HTML5 (Bootstrap 5) | Structural foundation and responsive utility classes. |
| **Styling** | Custom CSS | Styling the dark theme, hover effects, and CLI terminal appearance. |
| **Interactivity** | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) | Handling the sequential, character-by-character typing animations across the header and 'About' CLI. |
| **Security** | Formspree | Serverless form handling for secure email delivery. |
